# README:
# This patch allows testing of the intel-gpu-plugin with a simulated GPU in Kubernetes.
# The FAKEDRI_SPEC environment variable simulates an Intel GPU, enabling testing
# of GPU-based workload allocations without requiring real GPU hardware.
# It also mounts /tmp as a volume for temporary file storage.
#
# To apply this patch, run the following command:
# kubectl patch daemonset intel-gpu-plugin -n <namespace> --patch "$(cat fakedri-patch.yaml)"
# Replace <namespace> with the appropriate namespace (e.g., kube-system).
